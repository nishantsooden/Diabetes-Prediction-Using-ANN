# Diabetes Prediction System using ANN and Streamlit

## Overview
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is deployed using Streamlit for real-time prediction.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and outlier removal
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- ANN model built using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model deployment using Streamlit
- Real-time prediction with probability score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Pandas / NumPy

## Model Accuracy
75% accuracy on test data.

## How to Run
```bash
streamlit run Src/app.py
